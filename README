= rake_commit_tasks with java.rake

java.rake file enhances rake_commit_tasks to be usable with java development. 

If you are working on a java project with everything being built in ant you would not have the rake tasks available even after you install the rake_commit_tasks plugin. To facilitate the use of rake commit on your java project do the following

1. Checkout this project
2. Ensure that all rake commit code is in rake_commit_tasks folder.
3. Ensure you have ruby and rake installed on your machine.
4. run rake to build your application in java
5. run rake commit to be able to use the goodness of rake commit



== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/betarelease/rake_commit_tasks.git rake_commit_tasks
  rake commit
  
  By default the precommit task calls your 'ant <default>' target. 
  You can add more targets to java.rake

== Customization

=== Preventing checkins on broken builds

If you want the build to check your cruisecontrol instance and prompt you 
before checking in on a broken build, set CCRB_RSS to the location of the RSS feed.

For example, in your Rakefile:

  CCRB_RSS = 'http://example.com:3333/projects.rss'
