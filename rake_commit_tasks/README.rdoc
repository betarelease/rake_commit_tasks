= rake_commit_tasks

This plugin contains a set of rake tasks for checking your project into subversion.  The most important is:

  rake commit

which:

  1. Prompts for a commit message
  2. Adds new files to subversion
  3. Deletes missing files from subversion
  4. svn update
  5. Runs the default rake task (which should run your tests)
  6. Displays svn status
  7. Checks cruisecontrol.rb to see if the build is passing
  8. Checks in the code


The first version started with the code posted at Jay Field's Blog: http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-rake-commit.html
Improvements have been added in from several more projects.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/pgr0ss/rake_commit_tasks.git vendor/plugins/rake_commit_tasks
  rake commit

== Customization

=== Preventing checkins on broken builds

If you want the build to check your cruisecontrol.rb instance and prompt you 
before checking in on a broken build, set CCRB_RSS to the location of the RSS feed.

For example, in your Rakefile:

  CCRB_RSS = 'http://example.com:3333/projects.rss'

=== Automatically merging from branch to trunk

If you want the build to automatically merge changes to the trunk when checking in on the branch, set PATH_TO_TRUNK_WORKING_COPY to the location of the checked out trunk working copy.

For example, in your Rakefile:

  PATH_TO_TRUNK_WORKING_COPY = "/Users/someone/my_project_trunk"

Now, if you have a branch checked out into /Users/someone/my_project_1.1 and you do a rake commit, the checkin will be merged into the trunk after the change is committed to the branch.  Then, you can "cd /Users/someone/my_project_trunk" and check in the merged changes in the trunk.  This behavior is described in more depth at http://www.pgrs.net/2007/10/16/automatically-merge-changes-from-branch-to-trunk
